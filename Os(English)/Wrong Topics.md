## Wrong Topics

### First Unit

1. To access the services of operating system, the interface is provided by the **System calls**
2. **power failure,lack of paper in printer ,collection failure in the network** ,will be handled by operating system
3. **Disk** requires a device driver.
4. **Operating System** is built directly on the hardware.
5. **Process** is a program in execution
6. **Windows NT** is not a application software.
7. **DOS** does not support more than one program at a time.
8. Linux is a **open source** operating system
9. **Quick Response System** reads and reacts in actual time.
10. When a peripheral(外设) device needs immediate attention from operating system ,it generates an **interrupt**
11. **Handling interrupts** function must be provided by mordern OS
12. In operating systems,concurrency means **several events happen at  the same time interval**
13. Multiple processes can run in an environment where main memory does not interfere with each other. The operating system implements this through **memory allocation**
14. Multiprogramming means **run multiple programs concurrently on one processor at the same time**

### Second Unit

1. An interrupt breaks the execution of instructions and diverts its execution to **interrupt service routine**
2. If any interrupt request given to an input pin cannot be disabled by any means then the input pin is called **nonmaskable interrupt**
3. The return address from the interrupt-service routine（中断服务的返回地址） is stored on the **Processor stack**(处理器堆栈)
4. An interrupt that can be temporarily ignored is  **maskable interrupt**
5. CPU has two modes privileged and non-privilege. In order to change the mode from privileged to non-privileged, A s**oftware interrupt**  is needed.
6. **External interrupts** help connect the peripheral to processor.
7. What do the content of Instruction register specify?（指令寄存器的内容制定了什么）Op-code of the instruction being executed
8.
